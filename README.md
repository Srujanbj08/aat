## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srujanbj08/Heart_Disease_MLOPS.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:**
   ```env
   DATA_DIR=data
   ARTIFACTS_DIR=artifacts
   LOGS_DIR=logs
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Train the model (if not already trained):**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Launch the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser and navigate to** `http://localhost:8501`

## üíª Usage

### Single Patient Prediction

1. Navigate to "Single Prediction" in the sidebar
2. Enter patient details including age, sex, chest pain type, etc.
3. Click "Predict" to see the heart disease risk assessment

### Batch Prediction

1. Navigate to "Batch Prediction" in the sidebar
2. Prepare a CSV file with the required columns (see format in the app)
3. Upload the CSV file and click "Run Batch Prediction"
4. Download the results with predictions added

### Model Explanation

1. Navigate to "Model Explanation" in the sidebar
2. View feature importance chart and medical interpretation

## üîß Technical Details

### Model Information

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, ST slope
- **Preprocessing**: Standardization for numerical features, one-hot encoding for categorical features
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC

### Data Format

The application expects heart disease data with the following features:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `age` | Age in years | Numerical |
| `sex` | Sex (1 = male, 0 = female) | Binary |
| `cp` | Chest pain type (0-3) | Categorical |
| `trestbps` | Resting blood pressure in mm Hg | Numerical |
| `chol` | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl | Numerical |
| `fbs` | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) | Binary |
| `restecg` | Resting ECG results (0-2) | Categorical |
| `thalach` | Maximum heart rate achieved | Numerical |
| `exang` | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) | Binary |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise | Numerical |
| `slope` | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2) | Categorical |
| `target` | Heart disease diagnosis (1 = present, 0 = absent) | Binary |

## üìä Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~85% (varies with dataset)
- **Precision**: ~84%
- **Recall**: ~86%
- **F1 Score**: ~85%
- **ROC AUC**: ~0.90

## üõ†Ô∏è MLOps: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Render

This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline using modern DevOps practices for automated testing, building, and deployment.

### Pipeline Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `docker-build-push.yml` | CI workflow: builds Docker image and pushes to Docker Hub |
| `render-cd.yml` | CD workflow: triggers Render deployment on push |
| `Dockerfile` | Containerizes the ML app (Streamlit/FastAPI) |
| `app.py` | Sample ML app |
| `.env.example` | Template for environment variables |

### üîß GitHub Secrets Required

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub personal access token (PAT) |
| `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` | Render deploy hook URL |

### üöÄ How the Pipeline Works

1. **Developer pushes code** to `main` branch
2. **CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**:
   - Runs automated tests
   - Builds Docker image
   - Pushes image to Docker Hub
3. **CD Pipeline (Render)**:
   - Calls Render deploy hook
   - Pulls latest Docker image
   - Updates live application

### Pipeline Benefits

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures code quality before deployment
- **Containerization**: Consistent environments across development and production
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Seamless updates to the live application
- **Version Control**: Tagged Docker images for rollback capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline

## üî¨ Future Improvements

- Add more advanced explainability with SHAP and LIME
- Implement model monitoring for drift detection
- Add cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
- Enhance the UI with interactive visualizations
- Add user authentication for clinical settings
- Implement A/B testing for model versions
- Add automated model retraining pipelines
